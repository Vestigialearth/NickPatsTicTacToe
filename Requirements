--Create a piece of code that lets a player(s) play tic-tac-toe--
                        -Objectives-
  1. Create a simple output statement that greets the player and informs them of the rules. --Created, needs more detail.
  2. Design and implement a fairly simple input/graph representation to show the user(s) their moves. --Done.
  3. Design and implement a row and column system in order to both capture and be plugged into the table from step (3). --Done
  4. Make sure that the program runs and compiles --Done
  5. Make sure that run time is instant, or near instant. --Done
  6. Make sure that there are no bugs, and all invalid inputs are protected by some error checking method --Mostly done
  7. Bug test for any miscellaneous bugs --Done, the biggest bug is the input being crappy
  8. Have other people try and break the code to double test for bugs 


We need to do the following:
--Expand the input so that it doesnt crash unless input is exactly in the right format [# #]
--Add an AI, even one that randomly places X's or O's
--Count wins for either X or O
