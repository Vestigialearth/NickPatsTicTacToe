--Create a piece of code that lets a player(s) play tic-tac-toe--
                        -Objectives-
  1. Create a simple output statement that greets the player and informs them of the rules.
  2. Design and implement a fairly simple input/graph representation to show the user(s) their moves.
  3. Design and implement a row and column system in order to both capture and be plugged into the table from step (3).
  4. Make sure that the program runs and compiles
  5. Make sure that run time is instant, or near instant.
  6. Make sure that there are no bugs, and all invalid inputs are protected by some error checking method
  7. Bug test for any miscellaneous bugs
  8. Have other people try and break the code to double test for bugs
